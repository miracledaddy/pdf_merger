Hello user :)
You can take a look at a simple program which do the next things:
- it searches for any PDF file in the current working directory (where this project exists);
- merges them;
- and then creates new "combined_docs.pdf" file, which consist of the all found pdf files.
note: "combined_docs.pdf" file can be found in the current directory too.
Have a nice day!
